This is a final project for CS539(Machine Learning) class at WPI.

# Project Description

You final project is to do a novel data analysis to answer a research question on a dataset. The rough outline of the project is: Start with a research question and find data that might get at that question (you could also do this the other way around: you might find some dataset and then look to see what kinds of quantifiable research questions you could ask about it). Play around with the data. Attempt to answer the question. Iterate. Communicate.

Your project should have one significant contribution. Examples of a significant contribution might include things like:

    Putting together a novel data set (e.g., scraping something from the web)
    Answering an interesting research question
    Creating a "sophisticated" statistical/machine learning model
    Creating a really compelling series of visualizations that tell a story
    Optional: writing a shiny app
