# About

This Case Study3 is a clustering and correlation analysis on data from Counter Strike Global Offensive. I chose this dataset because I have been playing CSGO since 2014 and I thought it would be cool and fun to explore the data associated with it. There are several statistics in this dataset like player's name, country player is from, kill/death ratio, rating and so on. A k-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The dataset is partitioned into a set of groups based on their simillarity. The “Elbow” Method Probably is the most well known method to choose cluster numbers. Basically, the sum of squares at each number of clusters is calculated and graphed, and then we look for a change of slope from steep to shallow (an elbow) to determine the optimal number of clusters. This method is inexact, but good enough for my purposes. The actual plot of clusters can be seen on the last tab. In the next tab, you can check the correletion graphs between different variables. You can select which variables you'd like to see compared to one another and a scatterplot will be generated. Correlation plot is a good way to visualize how dependent are variables on each other.
